	<summary> <strong> History </strong> </summary>
	<p> CrossFit was founded in <strong> 2000 by Greg Glassman </strong> in Santa Cruz, California. Originally developed as a training program for police academies and military units, it combined elements of <strong> high-intensity interval training (HIIT), Olympic weightlifting, gymnastics, and functional movements. </strong> The method gained popularity through <strong> online workouts (WODs – Workouts of the Day) </strong> and an open-source model that encouraged community growth. In 2007, the first CrossFit Games were held, showcasing elite athletic performance and further boosting global recognition. Today, CrossFit is practiced in over <strong> 14,000 affiliated gyms worldwide. </strong> </p>

	<summary> <strong> Functional Movements </strong> </summary>
	<p> CrossFit is built around <strong> functional movements </strong>—exercises that mimic real-life actions like squatting, lifting, pushing, and pulling. These movements improve strength, coordination, and mobility in a way that supports everyday activities, making you not just fitter, but more capable in daily life. </p>

		<summary> <strong> History </strong> </summary>
		<p> Volleyball was invented in <strong> 1895 </strong> by <strong> William G. Morgan </strong>strong>, a YMCA physical education director in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Originally called <strong> “Mintonette,” </strong> it was designed as a less intense alternative to basketball for older members. The name was later changed to <strong> volleyball </strong> after someone observed the ball being volleyed back and forth. The sport quickly gained popularity, spreading internationally through YMCA networks. Volleyball became an <strong> official Olympic sport in 1964 </strong>, and today it’s played by millions worldwide, both indoors and on the beach. </p>
